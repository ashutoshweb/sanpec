        As the world stands at the crossroads of a climate and environmental crisis, it beckons a decisive call for
        action towards a global clean energy transition for a sustainable tomorrow. In the current global landscape,
        energy and climate challenges are formidable barriers to a sustainable and harmonious future, demanding urgent
        attention.

        Environmental impacts of excessive energy use and increasing price of energy present significant challenges
        for countries, businesses and organizations. From the socio-economic perspective, growing disparities in clean
        energy access and inequitable distribution of the benefits of public spending is hindering development. The
        transition to sustainable energy is also challenging due to financial, regulatory, and business inertia,
        slowing the clean energy transition. Electricity grid modernization faces hurdles with aging transmission and
        distribution (T&D) infrastructure. High capital cost is slowing the deployment of smart grid infrastructure
        for enabling demand side management and grid flexibility. Procedural delays in integrating distributed and
        intermittent renewable energy sources is leading to cost overruns. Cybersecurity threats also loom large,
        endangering critical electricity grid infrastructure.

        Electrification of energy demand is a potent solution which can usher in an era of a clean energy future and
        marks a pivotal shift towards sustainable practices. It entails transitioning various sectors like
        transportation and heating to electric power, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. As the backbone of a clean
        energy system, robust electrical grids can act as a highway for transfer of power enabling rapid
        transformation of the energy system into a cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally conscious one. The
        pursuit of sustainability also demands a shift towards circular economy principles.
